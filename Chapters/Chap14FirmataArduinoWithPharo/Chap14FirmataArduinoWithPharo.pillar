!! Lesson 14 â€“  Firmata implementation for the Pharo Programming Language.

Firmata is a generic protocol for communicating with microcontrollers from software on a host computer. 
It is intended to work with any host computer software package. Right now there is a matching object in a number of languages. 
It is easy to add objects for other software to use this protocol. 
Basically, this firmware establishes a protocol for talking to the Arduino from the host software. 
The aim is to allow people to completely control the Arduino from software on the host computer.
